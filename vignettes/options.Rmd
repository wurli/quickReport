There are several options in {quickReport} that you may want to adjust:

- `qr.default_template` can be used to specify the default workbook to use
as a template. This can be useful if you often need to create reports from 
the same template.
- `qr.marker` can be used to change the marker that indicates where data will
be placed in template worksheets. By default, the value is `"!data"`.
- `qr.quiet` can be used to suppress messages from `{quickReport}`
functions, though it is recommended that you leave them on.
- `qr.user` can be used to set the username recorded in the 'Creator' and
'Last Modified By' workbook fields. See `?get_user` for more info.

If you are unsure how to set options in R, see `?options` for more information.
